<h1 align="center">Hi 👋 I'm Evgeniia Golovina</h1>
<h3 align="center">Computational Scientist | Health Researcher | Mentor</h3>

Thank you for visiting my profile!

👩🏻‍💻  Currently I'm working as a Computational Scientist at [HPCNow!](https://hpcnow.com/).

😎  Also, I'm a Business Mentor at the [UoA Business School](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/business.html) and a Data Visualisation Mentor at [Data Visualisation Society](https://www.datavisualizationsociety.org/).

🧡  I'm passionate about Health Sciences, and I agree with Arkady and Boris Strugatsky that "the goal of science is human happiness" (“Monday Starts on Saturday” is my favourite book).

🔥  When I have free time I’m learning Chinese and Spanish, practising GO game, or studying Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence.
