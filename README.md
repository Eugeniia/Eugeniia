Thank you for visiting my profile! Here is what you need to know about me:

🧡  I have four big passions: Technology & Innovation, Data, People and Health Sciences. 

🤩  I'm fascinated by High-Performance Computing, Supercomputing and Quantum Computing technologies!  

👩🏻‍💻  And I'm currently working as a Computational Scientist at [Do IT Now](https://hpcnow.com/](https://www.doitnowgroup.com/ ).
