I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow doing research in Justin O’Sullivan “Genomics and System Biology” lab group, where we’re trying to understand the role of genetics and epigenetics in the development of complex traits. In particular, I'm focused on understanding the regulatory role of genetic variants associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Currently, I'm developing a Machine Learning approach to predict an individual’s predisposition to COPD and its multimorbidities.
